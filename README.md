FJ-GL
=====

A modern, faster OpenGL graphics plugin for Sphere 1.5 and 1.6

FJ-GL is an OpenGL-based video backend for Sphere 1.5, 1.6 beta, and the latest 1.6 source.
It has been tested to compile and work on Linux, and to compile on Windows. It requires libT5, which is distributed with TurboSphere.

FJ-GL is tested for performance. It should always be at least as fast as Sphere-GL (on Windows) and SDL-GL (on Linux). In most cases it will be faster than Sphere-GL or SDL-GL. It is tuned for best performance on systems with Mesa3D+DRI, Intel, and AMD OpenGL drivers.
